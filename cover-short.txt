My name is Ivan, I am 36 years old and have working experience since 2009 in machine learning research and applied projects with industrial customers, including Sberbank, Huawei, Bosch, Datadvance, and Airbus. I have been studying and working in machine learning since 2014. During this time I have tackled industrial and applied projects, and contributed to theoretical studies, e.g. machine learning approaches in combinatorial optimization, hierarchical reinforcement learning, time series forecasting, radio frequency signal processing, decentralized optimization for anomaly detection, sparse matrix decompositions, generating steganographic containers with GANs, variational Bayes and sparsification methods for deep learning.

I graduated from the MSc programme on computer science at the National Research University Higher School of Economics in 2016 and in 2020 I successfully completed my PhD studies on applied mathematics, computer science and engineering at Skoltech. My thesis research was focused on model sparsification: sparse-regularized matrix decompositions, variational dropout, and parameter pruning methods based on second-order loss approximation. My paper on Variational Dropout for Complex-valued deep networks was published at ICML2020.

I have advanced knowledge of python and have hands-on experience with developing extensions in C/Cython. I recognize the value of carefully prepared numerical experiments in evaluating research hypotheses, and the merit of place the results within a bigger picture. I know how to plan and carry out ablation studies, and clearly communicate and visualize the findings. When studying and doing research I prefer to take a broad integral look at the methods, track their interactions, figure out influences and relations to adjacent subfields. I have no problem with engaging with complex concepts in statistics, optimization and numerical methods, and differential geometry. I feel secure in my ability to distill and combine key ideas from diverse research fields, and enjoy communicating findings through papers, presentations and teaching materials.
